      <p>A 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who

      intellect and peak physical conditioning. This makes his fighting

      title="Manseok Gang" class="band-image">

      demeanor. After promising debuts during the preliminaries of the

      by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company,
      he grew up with a ''Might is right'' philosophy. Dubbed a monster
      by his opponents and team mates alike, Taek has an arrogant
      personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing
      everyone around him as insignificant trash. The only exception
      being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Ilpyo, his mortal enemy
      and the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament.

      <h2>-Taejin Jin</h2>
      <p>The adoptive grandfather of protagonist Mori. Probably the strongest
      Genuine Fighter of the series, Taejin is powerful enough to easily
      defeat gods by using his sole martial skills. His disdain for Borrowed
      Power and unlimited potential threaten the statu-quo between gods
      and humans and have made him the target of many secret organizations.
      He is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal
      Taekwondo, whom he taught Mori. His disappearance serves as the
      main motivation for Mori to join the GOH tournament.</p>

      <img src="img/mujin.jpg" alt="Mujin Park" width="300" height="300"
      title="Mujin Park" class="band-image">
      <h2>-Mujin Park</h2>
      <p>Main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the National Assembly of
      Korea, he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament.
      In the series, Mujin acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to
      achieve his goal of obtaining power in order to create a new world.
      Considered a prodigy and destined for greatness from a very young
      age, the best shaman in Korea even told him that he would become
      "a king who will revolutionize the world", setting the history of
      God Of High School into motion. His Borrowed Power is called
      "Longinus" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on
      each of Mujin's hands. The name Longinus is loosely based on the
      Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of Jesus during the
      Crucifixion. Longinus allows Mujin control over gravity and as
      a defensive shield. He commands a group of powerful humans
      specialized in Charyeok called commissioners or executives
      (Kor: 집행위원). These figures are responsible for recruiting
      contestants and running the God of Highschool Tournament.</p>

      <img src="img/o.jpg" alt="Commissioner o" width="300" height="300"
      title="Commissioner O" class="band-image">
      <h2>-Commissioner O</h2>
      <p>Member of the judges. Slightly shorter than the other executives,
      he has white, shoulder-length hair and dark-colored skin. O has won
      the first G.O.H tournament and, as such, is regarded by his
      colleagues as the strongest judge. His calm and perky character
      often makes him act as a mediator between the irritable R and the
      rash Q, often at each other's throat. He wields the Charyeok
      "Dragon slayer" which enables him to summon and command dragons
      as well as controlling fire. O is the one who recruited Mira
      for the G.O.H Tournament and appears fearful of the young woman,
      always avoiding eye contact with her and calling her "a monster".
      His true name is Sochun Yang.</p>

      <img src="img/p.jpg" alt="Commissioner P" width="300" height="300"
      title="Commissioner P" class="band-image">
      <h2>-Commissioner P</h2>
      <p>Only female member of the judges, she acts a Mujin personal secretary,
      almost never leaving his side. P is a serious, dutiful and professional
      executive as well as caring of her colleagues. She is a tall, slim
      woman, wearing a female version of the Judge's uniform with blue
      hair tied in a bun. P uses the Charyeok "Marionette" to create
      "dolls" or copies of other people and be connected to them thus
      knowing and seeing what they know and see.</p>

      <img src="img/q.jpg" alt="Commissioner Q" width="300" height="300"
      title="Commissioner Q" class="band-image">
      <h2>-Commissioner Q</h2>
      <p>Member of the judges. Recognizable by his tall stature, green hair
      and square glass. Q has a laid back if unorganized way of living
      his life, yet harbors an arrogant and act-before-thinking temper
      which often put him at odd with his boss and fellow commissioners.
      A running gag in the series is that whenever Q fights, his
      salary lessens. His Charyeok is "Joker", a scythe wielding
      jester-like entity he can summon with cards. Q recruited Daewi
      for the tournament and even trained him later on. He eventually
      married his student's older sister Daeryeong, with whom he
      has three kids.</p>

      <img src="img/r.jpg" alt="Commissioner R" width="300" height="300"
      title="Commissioner R" class="band-image">
      <h2>-Commissioner R</h2>
      <p>Member of the judges. R is a tall, slender man and wears the typical
      judge uniform. He has straight blonde hair going down his neck with
      narrow eyes that are often seen closed. Calm and collected, R is,
      like the other executives, proud of his strength. This makes him
      appear annoyed or vindictive when he is bested or doesn't get his
      way. R's Charyeok is unnamed and very unusual, as it enables him to
      forcibly take power from gods without their consent and control the
      wind. He was the one to recruit Mori for the tournament, inflicting
      the high-schooler his first defeat ever.</p>

      <img src="img/t.jpg" alt="Commissioner T" width="300" height="300"
      title="Commissioner T" class="band-image">
      <h2>-Announcer/Commissioner T</h2>
      <p>Member of the judge and the announcer of the GOH tournament.
      He has black spiky hair and orange sunglasses. Being himself blind,
      T also goes by the nickname Bogsa Sim, probably based on a blind
      character of a famous Korean Pansori story: Simcheongga. He has
      a long and pointed nose with shark-like teeth. Being a very
      skilled sword-man, T provides some advice to Mira for the tournament,
      even revealing he owes his blindness to an encounter with Mira's
      own family technique of the Moonlight Sword. His true name is
      Jeongso Sim.</p>
