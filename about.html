      <h2 class="name"  >Plot</h2>

      <p>The main protagonist is Mori Jin, a 17-year-old martial artist from
      Seoul, South Korea.[5] At the beginning of the story, he is invited
      to join a Martial Arts tournament called "The God of High School"
      (or GOH). The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together
      people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and
      then, national level in order to select three representatives for
      the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish
      fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.</p>

      <p>This intrigues Mori, and as he continues through the tournament,
      he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting.
      Martial arts aside, participants fight by using "Borrowed Power",
      a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons,
      mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the
      opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies:
      Full-Contact Karate expert Daewi Han and epeeist master Mira Yoo.
      These two would befriend Mori after their fights with him, and will
      become teamed together as the Korean Team after the preliminary
      rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams
      assemble, plans for many different people within the organization,
      and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve
      their goals.</p>
