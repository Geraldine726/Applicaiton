      title="Jim Mori">
        <h2>-Mori Jin</h2>
        <p>Nam Doh-Hyeong, Kim Bo-Na (김보나) (Young) (Korean); Robbie Daymond
        (English) A happy-go-lucky 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul,
        South Korea who practices a fictional version of the Korean martial art
        Taekwondo called Renewa Taekwondo (Korean: 리뉴얼 태권도) later shorted
        to Re-Taekwondo. Carefree, friendly and (rightfully so) self-proclaimed
        "Tough guy" (Korean: 쎈놈), Mo-Ri participates to the GOH tournament so
        that he can fight strong opponents and wish to be reunited with his
        grand-father Taejin. Later in the series, after the mystical "Borrowed
        Power" is introduced Mori is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning
        he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other
        beings (one chapter shows that he actually borrowed power from his clone).
        However, the reason Mori is so powerful is due to his true identity
        of the mythical Jaechondaesong, or Sun Wukong, the hero of the Chinese
        Novel Journey to the West.</p>

        <img src="img/mira.jpg" alt="Yoo Mira" class="about-band-image2"
        title="Yoo Mira">
        <h2>-Yoo Mira</h2>
        <p>A 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master
        of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean:
        월강도) which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially
        joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a
        suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Thanks to her
        friends Mori and Daewi, Mira let go of her family burden and will
        make a new path for herself. Mira's borrowed power is of an
        Ancient Chinese general named Lü Bu, which is loosely based on
        the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her
        several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability
        to summon a red horse (based on Red Hare, the legendary steed of Lü Bu).
        After RagnarÖk, she becomes one of The Six and leader of Neo Nox, a
        merger of National Assembly of the Homeless and Sang Man-Duk's faction
        of Nox. She also gains some abilities of Han Daewi via Fundamental
        Force Manipulation.</p>

        <img src="img/daewi.jpg" alt="Daewi Han" class="about-band-image3"
        title="Daewi Han">
        <h2>-Han Daewi</h2>
        <p>Sean Chiplock (English)
        A 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices
        Full-Contact Karate.[9] Daewi starts off the series as a hard-working
        young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due
        to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, he
        participates to cure his friend of the disease. After his friend's
        death, Daewi finds a new purpose in his life through his friendship
        with Mori and Mira and now wants to help them fulfill their dreams.
        A tall, lazy-looking young man with a loner personality, he is
        nonetheless fiercely loyal to his friends and willing to go to
        great lengths to protect them. His Borrowed Power is that of a
        Haetae, a Korean mythical creature with the ability to control
        water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting
        attacks. After RagnarÖk, he has the Wisdom of the Sage, which
        allows him to manipulate gravity, electromagnetism, and even
        nature itself. He also becomes one of The Six.</p>
